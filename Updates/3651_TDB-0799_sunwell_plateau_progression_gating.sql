Early/Beta Patch 2.4.0 Sunwell Plateau "Attunement" System 
----------------------------------------------------------
Apparently PTR exclusive depending on which region you're looking at. 
All content - quests/items/gossips (along with corresponding worldstates/conditions) related to the gate objects within Sunwell Plateau can be created in 2.4.3 client.
Adding it here so it may be optionally used depending on server admin preference.

3 quests starting from Archmage Ne'thul 25169, 3 gate gameobjects
11551 Agamath, the First Gate -> 187766 Agamath, The First Gate
11552 Rohendor, the Second Gate -> 187764 Rohendor, The Second Gate
11553 Archonisus, the Final Gate -> 187765 Archonisus, The Third Gate
cmangos already has 6 gate spawns - 2 of each type (one inside of Sunwell, and another inside of Magister's Terrace presumably for show)
currently they're all open state, but they'll be updated in instance files to start closed and instead despawn based on game events

34544 Essence of the Immortals
Essence of the Immortals was for some time on the PTR for Patch 2.4 a drop from 25-person raid bosses in the Sunwell Plateau.
Also, end-game bosses such as Lady Vashj, Prince Kael'thas, Archimonde and Illidan were dropping one essence per kill.
Blizzard replaced the Immortals-system by having the three gates open automatically over time at equal intervals on all servers.

Sunwell Plateau "Attunement":
The instance was open to players right from the start of patch 2.4, but the last 3 bosses were only available as each gate - which blocked the next boss encounter - opened over a set period of time on all servers.
(Although this happened on maintenance day, so the US had an apparent one day advantage over the EU servers)[1] (cites bluepost)

The first gate was opened on 8 April 2008 in the US, two weeks after the patch went live. The second gate opened after weekly maintenance on April 29, 2008. The third and final gate was opened on May 20, 2008 on US realms.
The difficulty of the instance was set at the first 3 bosses being on par with Tier 6 encounters, and then the last three and increasing from each.

So far, it seems that the following is true on PTR:
1. This item drops off the first, second and third bosses in the Sunwell 25-man instance. Guaranteed drop on every kill.
2. Each time that one of these items is handed in, it increases the progress for the entire server towards opening the gate behind the 3rd boss.
3. It seems that it will require a total of 80 hand-ins to open the gate. This may be a low number for the PTR and may increase for live servers. No way to know right now.
So, the more guilds raiding and killing the bosses, the faster everyone gets through the gate and to 4th boss.

Some more specific notes found on the Essence turn-ins:
At last check on the PTR, Ne'thul says that the first barrier, Agamath, is down to 46%.
Right now, estimates are that each Essence of the Immortals will bring the barrier down by 1.25%, which means that each server will need 80 total Essences - that is, 80 kills of the first three bosses 
------------

Here's the original bluepost/thread explaining why they decided to change course on this:
http://urbad.net/blue/us/4976251142-Essence_of_Immortal_plea_for_help
OP:
"
Please make Essence of Immortal requirements based on server progression. It would make it extremely more fair to guilds that are dominating their server such as ours.
Were currently the only Alliance guild in BT/Hyjal, and the best progressed horde is like 3/9 4/5 and not moving fast, the other horde guild (totalling 3 in BT/Hyjal) is 4/5 0/9. That gives you some kind of idea of how bad this server really is.
Gates of AQ at least gave a chance to low pop/bad servers, because if they really wanted to 1 guild COULD do the ENTIRE war effort. We cant do that because of weekly lock outs on bosses that drop Essence of Immortals.
So on the day 2.4 opens my guild is able to farm 7 EoI a week.Assuming the 2 horde guilds in BT/Hyjal farm vashj/kael every week, + the 2 alliance guilds killing vashj, who may have Kael down by then, thats a total of 15 EoI a week for the entire server, best case scenario.

Us: Illidan, Arch, Vashj, Kael, Kalecgos, Bruttalus, Felmyst = 7
Horde guild A: Vashj + Kael = 2
Horde guild B: Vashj + Kael = 2
Alliance guild A: Vashj + Kael = 2
Alliance guild B: Vashk + Kael = 2
= 15.
Maybe another guild will surprise us and farm Vashj by then, so even call it 16 a week.

Thats exactly 5 weeks, of every possible EoI being farmed, before we unlock the 4th boss.
At that rate its going to take us over a month to open the 1st gate, not to mention the other 2. We'll be lucky if Kil'Jaeden is available to us before WotLK comes out.

Meanwhile we'll be grinding the same bosses we've been killing for months on end, watching all the high pop servers farming Kil'Jaeden, wondering why we didn't have a fair shot to make our name known across the world.
From what every raider experienced in the months prior to The Burning Crusade came out, it became increasingly hard to fill a raid, simply because of the fact everyone knew that in a few months all that gear and work would be for nothing.
Once again we have an expansion looming over us that is threatening the same events. This is just one more reason that low pop/under progressed servers will not be able to see Kil'Jaeden.

Blizzard claimed they were upset so few people got to see the majority of Naxx pre TBC, and yet this is turning out to be the same scenario all over again. The only way this is not true is if WotLK is still the better part of a year past 2.4's release, in which case you will simply have all the raiding guilds on the high pop servers bored for 6+ months so as to insure the low pop servers see all the content.
Either way I really can't see a benefit for anyone, Blizzard or player base, to not stagger the amount of EoIs needed to open these gates.
"
Blizz Response:
"
Apologies that this update is coming so late but we pulled the Essence of Immortal quest chain about 2 weeks ago. That's why you haven't seen it on the Public Test Realm. The 3 gates will open automatically over time at equal intervals on all servers.
Regarding the taking back of the town on the Isle, however, that will still be dependent on completion of daily quests. Servers can race to see who can open their quest hub the fastest. But access to raid bosses has been made equal.
We really like the concept of cross-server competition. But the concept of the gates being tied to specific boss kills was not playing out as we had hoped. We plan to do future things that involve servers competing with one another through major events.

25525 "The Shattered Sun Offensive has made great progress in the outer areas of the Isle of Quel'Danas. Kil'jaeden's forces are being pushed back, and in the chaos I was able to lead a small scouting force here inside the Sunwell Plateau. My troops proceeded through Parhelion Plaza, spotted a group of Sunblade blood elves, and we then engaged the enemy. That fight quickly turned into a disaster."
25526 "What went wrong?"
25527 "Kil'jaeden's defenders here on the Sunwell Plateau are much stronger than anything we faced outside on the Island. The Legion have even twisted our Arcane Guardian technology with fel energy to create something much more sinister. Just one of those Sunblade Protectors decimated my troops, and I ordered a swift retreat. I expected my squad to be pushed completely off the plateau, but the enemy surprised me by calling off the pursuit."
25528 "Why did they stop?"
25529 "I don't know, but I'm glad they did. The respite has allowed Anchorite Elbadon to save many of the men and women under my command. I've sent a few of my stealthiest scouts forward, and they've reported back something interesting. Nearly all of the Sunblade Protectors are powered down! Kil'jaeden's forces appear to be conserving their energy, and seem content to merely contain us with one active Protector. If you and your companions want to force your way inside, allow me to suggest a plan of attack."
25530 "Your insight is appreciated."
25531 "Take advantage of their deactivated Sunblade Protectors. If one of their Sunblade Scouts spot you, I'm sure the elf will try to reactivate a nearby Sunblade Protector. Kill him quickly to prevent this. With the blood elves eliminated, as long as you do not trigger the Protector's proximity sensors you should be able to move past them without a fight. That will save you both time and resources."
